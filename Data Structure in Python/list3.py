# Example 3: Modifying List Elements
# Lists are mutable, which means that you can modify the elements of a list after it has been created. You can change the value of a specific element, add new elements, or remove existing elements from a list.
# You can modify the elements of a list by accessing them using their index and assigning a new value to them.

# Example List
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Modify the element at index 2
my_list[2] = 30

# Print the modified list
print('Modified List:', my_list)
